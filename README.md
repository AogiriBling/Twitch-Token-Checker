# Twitch-Token-Checker
Over powered Token checker which checks locked tokens for follow bot and invalid/valid tokens, usually tokens gets blacklisted or banned or overused so tokens dont follow users but this checker checks those locked tokens and valid working ones also!

This checker was not made by me this server was made by oxyn#9552 his server is https://discord.gg/ziro


IMPORTANT : MAKE A FOLDER CALLED "out" and put 2 txt in it called locked.txt and valid.txt before running it!
